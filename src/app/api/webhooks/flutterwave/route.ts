/**
 * Flutterwave signs every webhook with a plain secret-hash string (not
 * HMAC) delivered in the `verif-hash` header — this must match exactly
 * what's configured in the Flutterwave dashboard under Settings >
 * Webhooks. This is the safety net for the whole payment system: it's
 * what completes a purchase or payout if the buyer/admin closes their
 * browser tab right after the redirect, instead of relying purely on the
 * client calling /verify.
 *
 * Security: per Flutterwave's own best-practices guidance, this handler
 * NEVER trusts the webhook payload directly for the fields that matter
 * (status, amount, tx_ref) — it always re-queries the Verify API using
 * the payload's id, and only acts on what that trusted response says.
 * This defends against a forged webhook claiming a payment succeeded
 * when it didn't.
 *
 * Idempotency: Flutterwave may deliver the same event more than once.
 * Every handler here is safe to call twice — quizPurchaseService and
 * resourceService both check `status === 'completed'/'confirmed'` before
 * doing anything, and payoutRequestService's mark-paid/mark-failed
 * functions no-op if already in that terminal state.
