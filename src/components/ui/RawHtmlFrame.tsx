/**
 * A viewport meta tag alone stops the browser from *scaling down* a
 * desktop-width page, but it doesn't help if the author's own CSS hardcodes
 * pixel widths (e.g. `body { width: 1080px }`, a wrapper `<div
 * style="width:1000px">`, or a wide fixed-width table). In that case the
 * content renders at true 1:1 size but still doesn't fit the phone — it
 * just looks "boxed in" with dead space on either side, or gets clipped.
 *
 * This stylesheet is appended (not prepended) so it wins the cascade
 * against the author's own <style> block via source order, while staying
 * low-specificity enough not to break intentional layouts:
 * - Caps body/html and common wrapper elements to 100% of the viewport
 *   width instead of a fixed px value.
 * - Lets any element that's still wider than the viewport (e.g. a big
 *   table) scroll horizontally in its own box, rather than blowing out
 *   the whole page width.
 * - Forces all images/media to scale down to fit.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — do not force `width: auto !important` on generic block
 * containers here. An earlier version of this override did that (on
 * body/div/section/article/main/header/footer) to collapse fixed-pixel
 * "boxed card" wrappers back to fluid width. That works for simple
 * documents, but it actively breaks any author layout built with CSS
 * Grid or Flexbox: a grid/flex *item* with `width: auto !important`
 * stops stretching to fill its track/flex-basis and instead shrinks to
 * its content's intrinsic size. A two-column `display:grid;
 * grid-template-columns: 260px minmax(0,860px)` layout, for example,
 * would have its main content column collapse to a narrow, "boxed"
 * width with dead space beside it — the exact symptom this override
 * exists to prevent, just reintroduced by the override itself.
 * `max-width: 100%` alone (below) is sufficient to stop a fixed-pixel
 * wrapper from overflowing the viewport, without fighting the author's
 * own layout system.
