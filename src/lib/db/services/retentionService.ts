 * Data retention: keeps D1 (5GB free tier) from growing without bound.
 *
 * What is pruned, and why it is safe:
 *  - attempt_answers: per-question detail of a recorded attempt. Nothing
 *    scoring-related reads it. The leaderboard, dashboard score chart, and
 *    "already attempted" gate all read quiz_attempts, which is NEVER pruned.
 *    Its only readers are the "Retake missed" feature (falls back to the
 *    full question set when there is nothing to filter by) and the
 *    question-delete safety check in updateQuiz (pruning only makes more
 *    questions deletable).
 *  - email_log: only the send-once types are ever read back
 *    (hasEmailBeenSent for welcome + certificate_issued), so those are kept.
 *  - banner_stats: optional very-old daily counters.
 *
 * All limits are admin-configurable and stored in site_settings.
